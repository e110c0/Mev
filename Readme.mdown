Mev & Megi
==========

Mev is a measurement microframework to handle all kinds of network measurements
in an evented fashion it is developed as part of the iStrukta Project at the TU
MÃ¼nchen. It is based on Nodejs to provide a useful event mechanism. In order to
provide a maximal output no state is held inside the application per measurement
request, but it is passed via the events, this enables massive parallel
measurements.

Megi is a Webfrontend based on [Codeignitor](http://codeigniter.com/) to ease
the usage of Mev and to provide a visual feedback.
